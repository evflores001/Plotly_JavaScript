## Analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to parse through a json file containing data about bacteria found within the human navel. Using javascript, HTML, Plotyl, and D3, the json data was used to create visual graphs representing top 10 bacterias found per sample as well as belly button washing frequency guage chart and a bubble chart. These charts will dynamically change according to sample selected from the dropdown menu.

Some additional changes made to the style of the webpage include change in the background color, text color and adding a summary towards the bottom of the webpage.
